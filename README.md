*Disclaimer: I am completing this project with students at Seven Academy to illustrate to them fundermental backend and express concepts*

Openswap is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace where buyers and sellers are connected for business, This platform provides a variety of rates for crypto sellers and well-secured payment methods, 
Crypto-swap is 100% decentralized since no one is imposing a price or rates on anyone and the seller can loop through a list of buyers to choose what is best for him.
